The ec2 instances are untargeted and may be deployed in one or more availaiblity zones. The web site is available on port 80, however, the instances can be configured to listen on any port (8888 by default). **WARNING** This template creates one or more Amazon EC2 instances and an Elastic Load Balancer. You will be billed for the AWS resources used if you create a stack from this template.")
